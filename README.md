# Computaional-Physics-Problems-and-Practice
This repository is meant to show my progress in Computational physics problems. I will attempt to use this to post tutorials on new techniques that I am learning. 

I will intially store my Computational Physics Problem Sets and Projects. I hope to work on more Projects in the near future and will post any progress here.
